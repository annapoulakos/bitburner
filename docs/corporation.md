# Corporations

In BitNode 4,  you get access to Corporations. When you get SourceFile 4.3, you can use Corporation API in all other BitNodes (unless explicitly disabled).

## Basics

There are a lot of guides out there on how to make a lot of cash from corporations. While they definitely have their merit, I find that most of my time is spent on just creating a corporation, getting a few augs installed and then resetting. I need cash in the short-term in order to buy 5-10 augs before a reset.

Sure, I could easily expand this to follow other guides and make money to throw at factions, but I found that it was time-consuming and ultimately easier to just do resets for augs to reach the end game.

## Overview

I follow this formula:

* Step One: Create your corporation. (I do this step manually, because it's easy and I don't have to do a lot).
* Step Two: Use script to create an agricultural division
* Step Three: Use script to expand agri division to all six cities with some default settings
    * Three employees (Operations, Engineer, Management)
    * Purchase and upgrade warehouse to 300 capacity
    * Purchase 27,000 Real Estate, 75 AI Cores, and 125 Hardware
    * Set Plant and Food to sell MAX at MP
    * Enable Smart Supply
* Step Four: When ready to purchase augs and reset
    * Go Public
    * Immediately sell 999,999,999 shares
    * Sell CEO position and create a new company with seed money.
* Step Five: Run steps 1-4 prior to resetting for augs.

> [!NOTE]
> You need to wait 60 minutes between selling shares on one reset and selling them on the next. That gives you some time to sort out your plan on the next reset.
